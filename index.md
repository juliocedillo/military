The margin between the Democratic and Republican share of the Latino vote is narrowing, reflecting a shift in political engagement. Since 2016, more Latinos have identified with the Republican Party, raising questions about Latino assimilation. Krogstad et al. (2022) found Latinos are more likely to believe the Democratic Party cares more about their interests than the Republican Party, while Chatagnier (2022) showed military service is correlated with conservative voting. As Latinos are the largest minority demographic in the US, with increasing rates of enlistment, this may offer insight into conservatism as a form of assimilation into American society. Previous studies on Latino assimilation have focused on generational trends and socioeconomic factors, but military-focused research among Latinos is diminishing.
