He is an Associate Professor of Sociology and co-directs the Latinx Social Science Pipeline initiative and the Anticolonial Lab.

He received his PhD (Sociology) from Brown University, his MA (Sociology) from the University of Illinois-Chicago, and his BA (Political Science and Mexican and Caribbean Studies) from Northeastern Illinois University.

With colleagues in Chicago, he co-leads Digitizing the Barrio, a Puerto Rican-focused community archive.
