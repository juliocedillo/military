## [Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects Approval Letter](assets/pdf/ApprovalLetter-IRB2025-04-18454.pdf)
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an administrative body established to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects recruited to participate in research activities conducted under the auspices of the institution with which it is affiliated.

The IRB is charged with the responsibility of reviewing, prior to its initiation, all research (whether funded or not) involving human participants. The IRB is concerned with protecting the welfare, rights, and privacy of human subjects. The IRB has the authority to approve, exempt, disapprove, monitor, and require modifications in all research activities that fall within its jurisdiction as specified by both the federal regulations and institutional policy. The IRB shall have at least five members of varying backgrounds in order to provide complete and adequate review of human research and its institutional, legal, scientific, and social implications. The Board will also include at least one member who is not affiliated with the institution and one member who is not a scientist. The IRB has several consultants who advise the Board and are periodically involved in protocol review.

The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) is comprised of two groups that serve as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) for the University of California, Berkeley. The primary mission of the IRB is to ensure the protection of the rights and welfare of all human participants in research conducted by university faculty, staff, and students. The Office for Protection of Human Subjects (OPHS) is the administrative office that supports the CPHS.
