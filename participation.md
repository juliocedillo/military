  <summary>What will you ask about in interviews?</summary>
  <p>There are five central themes in the interview questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cultural Upbringing</strong>
      <p>These questions will ask the participant about their childhood, familial influences, and how they were socialized. Through this process, participants will talk about their cultural identity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decision to Enlist</strong>
      <p>These questions will ask the participant why they decided to join the military–i.e., for patriotic purposes, influence, or social mobility. Through these questions, participants will talk about understanding the responsibilities and benefits based on the commitment. If applicable, questions will also ask those who’ve decided to re-enlist.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Experiences in the Military</strong>
      <p>These questions ask about their lived experiences in the military. Questions will be asked about BMT/MCT/Bootcamp Training, influences of leadership, connecting with other Latinos in the military, racial dynamics, and the political landscape of their deployment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Patriotism and Self Perception</strong>
      <p>These questions will be asked to see how Latino soldiers think about their cultural identity and sense of belonging in the United States. In turn, these questions ask them how they view themselves in the broader Latino community. This theme seeks to understand if there were any influences in the military to change one’s perspective.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Voting and Political Identification</strong>
      <p>The last theme will ask about participants’ political opinions and how they decide to vote–in the interest of family, Latinos, military, or party affiliations. These questions will inquire participants on how they navigate political disagreements with colleagues and family (if applicable). Ultimately, these questions will ask participants about their political party alignment and how and why they’re involved in politics.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
